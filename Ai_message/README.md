AI Engineer Selection Task
Build a small AI-based system that processes customer messages and produces three outputs
for each message:
1. Classify the message into one category such as Complaint, Refund/Return, Sales
Inquiry, Delivery Question, Account/Technical Issue, General Query, or Spam.
2. Identify the sentiment of the message as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
3. Generate a short, professional auto-reply appropriate for the message.
You may use any free LLM or API of your choice.
Create a simple script, program, or minimal interface that performs these steps.
Deliverable:
Record a video screen capture showing the system running. The video must clearly
demonstrate:
● The input messages
● The system processing them
● The final outputs for each message (category, sentiment, auto-reply)
